# Machine Learning Term Project

## Graph Neural Networks

I did this project as a term project for my Machine Learning course in MS Data Science.

#### Project Summary

The study introduces Hyper-SAGNN, a graph representation learning model that predicts hyperedges on homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs using self-attention mechanism.
